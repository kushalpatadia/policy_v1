          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
          		<div style=" text-align:center;">
          		 <p>Accord Mortgages are the intermediary arm of Yorkshire Building Society, that’s mortgage broker or
consultant only lender with some really great products, which include offset products, free
valuations, cashback deals, need we say more?</p>
<p>Accord is a great contractor friendly lender with a dynamic approach, the underwriters are superb,
with a good mandate for allowing discretions.</p>
<p>They are a lender who are willing to lend and take an individual view on client’s circumstances.</p>
<p>Accord’s policy towards day rate contractors is as follows</p>
<ul>
<li> Accord has a minimum qualifier for contractors, which is that the gross contract value needs
to be £75,000, so this equates to £289 per day, based upon 52 weeks.</li>
<li> Accord also considers contractors on a rate</li>
<li> Accord will also consider contractors on a day rate of £400, who work less than the 5-day
week, and do not reach the £75,000 minimum threshold.</li>
<li>Accord will either require you to have 3 months remaining on your contract in which case
they ask for just 12 months contracting history as part of the packaging request, but if you
have less than 3 months remaining, then they will want you to provide 24 months
contracting history.</li>
<li>Accord will want to see some time remaining on your contract, like 4 weeks, you do not
need a lengthy time remaining, they understand that contracts are short term and do not
insist on more than four weeks, if you have less than this, they will more than likely ask for
an extension or new contract that you will be moving onto.</li>
<li> Accord do not like gaps in employment history, obviously, having holiday or taking a few
weeks out is not an issue, but if you have several months off in the 12 months, then it may
be better to look at one of our other contractor friendly lenders. Accord will consider
contractor mortgage applications with up to 8 weeks between contract, so pretty generous.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accord will calculate your gross contract value in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li> Accord tend to take your day rate then multiply by 5 days then multiply this by 46 weeks to
reach the gross contract value.</li>
<li> They will not utilise the average of the previous year to reach an average day rate.</li>
<li> For example, if on a day rate or hourly rate
o £289 per day x 5 days x 46 weeks = £66,470 gross contract value
o £42 per hour x (number of hours stipulated or 37.5 hours default) x 46 weeks =
£72,450 gross contract value</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to package your application, we will require: having everything up front makes our job
easier and ensures that we can present your application to the Accord contractor mortgages
underwriter in a presentable fashion so that they can swiftly make a decision that will be positive.</p>
