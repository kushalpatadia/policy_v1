day rate.</p>

the different stress calculations in order to place you with the right lender at the best interest rate
possible. Buy to let mortgages are assessed utilising the rental income of the subject property and
this needs to be demonstrated to the lender that even in extreme condition sthe rent will finance
the buy to let mortgage.</p>

brokers understand how these work and which lenders are best to place these with.</p>

limited company approach when deciding how to progress with your investment</p>

criteria</p>

want its own surveyor to go out and view the property.</p>

been completed, the lender will issue you with a formal mortgage offer.</p>
