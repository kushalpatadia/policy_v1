          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
<p>Relevant life for contractors is a policy that is paid for by the limited company, and
gives the contractor a tax efficient manner to save on the premiums as it is treated a
business expense, the benefits are paid tax free into a discretionary trust, the key is
to ensure that the trust is set up the correct way and your advisor at contractor
mortgages direct is familiar with these trusts.</p>
<p>The potential savings with relevant life plans can be up to 55% cheaper than setting
up a traditional life insurance policy, read on for more information</p>
<p><strong>What is Contractor Relevant Life Insurance</strong></p>
<p>A Relevant Life Plan is a term assurance plan available to employers to provide an
individual death in service benefit for an employee. It is designed to pay a lump sum
if the employee dies whilst employed during the length of the policy. It will also pay-
out if the employee, whilst employed, is diagnosed with a terminal illness and meets
our definition at any time during cover. A Relevant Life Plan is paid for by the
employer.</p>
<p>The most common type of life assurance for contractors is called Relevant Life
Insurance. The advantage of this policy relative to a personal life policy is that it’s
owned and paid for by your limited company.</p>
<p>Relevant life is a tax efficient way for small businesses (including limited companies
with just one employee) to offer life insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Tax-deductible Life Insurance</strong></p>
<p>It usually counts as a tax-deductible business expense and comes with monthly or
annual premiums are that guaranteed to remain fixed over the term of the policy, so
you won’t get any nasty premium rises in the future.</p>
<p>The benefits paid out from the policy should also be free from inheritance tax as the
policy would be written in trust (these policies come with a specialist trust called a
Relevant Life Trust).</p>
<p>As with other forms of term insurance, there is no cash in value at any time and if the
premiums are not paid, then cover stops.</p>
<p>Who is it designed for</p>
<p>Relevant life insurance is aimed typically at small businesses where there may be
only a sole director or a few employees, but where the number of staff is insufficient
for a group life insurance scheme.</p>
<p>If you are working for an umbrella company?</p>
<p>Some contractors work for an umbrella company, which acts as an employer for
those on fixed term contracts. They pay invoices, make PAYE deductions and may
offset expenses. In this case if you have not formed a limited company, we
recommend straightforward personal life insurance.</p>
<p>Sole trader?</p>
<p>Some contractors merely register for self-employment without forming a limited
company, particularly in the early days when they may be earning less. Sole traders
should also take out personal life insurance, which we can provide guidance and
quotes on also.</p><br/>
<p><strong>What options are available to me</strong></p>
<p>When taking out life assurance there are a number of options you will need to decide
on, with the main ones being as follows:</p>
<p>Level of cover</p>
<p>This is the amount that the insurer will pay to your loved ones should you pass way.
With relevant life cover for contractors there is usually the limit of you being able to
cover up to 15-20 times your total remuneration (which can usually include
dividends).</p>
<p>When setting the level of cover, it makes sense to consider how much your partner /
children would need to live a comfortable life if you weren’t there to provide for them.
It is common to ensure that any debts can be repaid and your family can survive
without your income for a number of years, often until a child reaches adulthood.</p>
<p>Length of cover</p>
<p>This is how long you would like the policy to run. It is common for the plan to run to
the point where you think your family would be financially secure. For example, it
might run until your children have grown up and your partner’s debts have been
repaid. With relevant life policies there is usually a maximum age the policy can run
to of 70 years old.</p>
<p>Level or decreasing term</p>
<p>It’s possible for your level of cover to remain fixed over the life of the policy or for the
level of cover to decline over time so it reaches zero at the end of the policy term.
Decreasing term plans are often used to cover liabilities that decline over time, such
as to cover a repayment mortgage or total outstanding school fees (which declines
as your child goes through another school year).</p>
<p>Including critical illness cover</p>
<p>With life plans it’s usually possible to include critical illness cover so the plan could
also pay-out if you suffered a very serious illness or injury, such as a lot of types of
cancer.</p>

<p>With relevant life cover the vast majority of insurers do not offer critical illness cover
with the policy as they are of the understand that if the policy includes illness
protection then it may not qualify for corporation tax relief and/or any pay-out from
the policy would be taxable as income.</p>
<p>Considering income protection</p>
<p>If you’re also interested in illness protection then it makes sense to consider income
protection, which pays out a monthly benefit if you are unable to work due to illness
or injury. There are also specialist plans for contractors which we can run through
with you.</p><br/>
<p style="text-decoration:underline;">Example of contractor tax savings</p>
<p>Tax liabilities may vary depending upon a significant number of factors and
contractors should seek advice from an accountant on the specific taxation issues
relating to their business.</p>
<p>However, in general terms, the most popular form of life cover for contractors,
relevant life insurance is:</p>
<ul>
<li> Not classed as a taxable benefit in kind</li>
<li> The premium paid by the business is treatable as a tax-deductible business expense</li>
<li> Excluded from both employee and employer National Insurance calculations</li>
<li> Unlike group plans, relevant life doesn’t count towards your lifetime pension allowance</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, supposing the premium comes to £50 per month. With a personal plan,
a higher rate taxpaying contractor would need a gross dividend of £66.25 to pay the
premium (i.e. an extra £16.25 for personal income tax at a 32.5% marginal rate),
meaning the business would need a gross profit of £82.81 to fund that dividend (i.e.
after having to pay corporation tax at 20%).</p>
<p>The tax efficient life cover</p>
<p>Now, with life insurance for contractors (relevant life cover) the business would
own and pay for the policy rather than it being taken out and paid for personally.
Thus, there would be corporation tax relief on the £50 per month premium, resulting
in a net premium of £40.</p>
<p>Therefore, with a contractor life policy there is a saving of £42.81 per month (£82.81
less £40), or a staggering 52%.</p>
<p>Please note the potential saving will vary depending on your marginal rate of income
tax and the sole purpose of taking out the policy cannot be to avoid tax. Although it
helps in reducing that corporation tax bill.</p>
