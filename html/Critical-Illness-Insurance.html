          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
<p>Critical illness insurance pays out a lump-sum amount if you were to suffer any one
of the critical illness conditions stated in the policy, so long as that occurs during the
term of the policy.</p>
<p>Although some plans cover as few as 35 specific conditions it is possible to gain
cover for over 100 conditions with some insurers. For an average critical illness
policy covering around 40 conditions, approximately 80% of claims are for cancer,
heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>As a contractor, can you really afford not to have any cover in place if you were to be
diagnosed with a critical illness… It won’t happen to me I hear you say, I’m sure
everyone.</p>
<p>How it works</p>
<p>As critical illness cover pays out a lump-sum amount it is often used to protect a
loan, such as a mortgage. The plan can be set-up so the level of cover remains fixed
over time to protect an interest only mortgage or set-up so the amount of cover
declines over time to protect a principal repayment mortgage.</p>
<p>Another benefit of critical illness insurance paying out a lump-sum is that it can be
used to make home modifications, such as installing a stair lift. It can also provide a
level of capital to fund monthly outgoings for a period of time whilst recovering.</p>
<br/><p>Risks of Critical Illness</p>
<p>Cancer Research UK (2012) state that around 325,000 people are diagnosed with
cancer every year and that 1 in 3 of us will develop cancer at some point in our lives.
Given this it is not surprising that approximately 60% of all critical illness claims are
for cancer.</p>
<p>In addition, the British Heart Foundation (2012) states that around 152,000 people
suffer a stroke each year and 103,000 suffer a heart attack.</p>
<p>With advances in medicine a greater proportion of people are surviving these critical
illnesses than ever before. For example, the British Heart Foundation (2012)
estimates that there about 1.2 million people living in the UK that have had a stroke.
It is therefore very important to consider how you would survive financially whilst
recovering or if you were never able to return to work.</p>
<p><strong>How do I choose the provider?</strong></p>
<p>When looking for the best critical illness insurance there are a number of important
factors to consider, which include the number of conditions covered and the pay-out
rate for that policy.</p>

<p>Firstly, it makes sense to find out how many critical illness conditions are covered by
the policy, which can range from as few as 35 to over 100. It is also worth seeing
how many ‘ABI definitions’ the policy uses. The Association of British Insurers (ABI)
has written model critical illness definitions as a best practice, which is optional for
insurers to follow.</p>
<p>Secondly, one guide to the quality of the policy and integrity of the insurer may be
based on the pay-out rate for that plan. Some insurers do not publish their pay-out
rates whereas others frequently publish pay-out rates well above 90% of all claims
made.</p>
<p><strong>Should I combine with life insurance?</strong></p>
<p>Critical illness cover is most commonly taken out as an add-on with life insurance.
The combined life insurance with critical illness cover policy would usually pay-out on
the first event of either death or you suffering a critical illness condition.</p>
<p>This type of cover is normally taken out together because the price of a standalone
critical illness policy is usually exactly the same as a life policy with critical illness
cover. This is due to certain insurer tax advantages available for life insurance and
the fact that there is such a high chance of suffering a critical illness before death.</p>
