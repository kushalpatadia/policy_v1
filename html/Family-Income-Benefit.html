          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
<p>Family Income Benefit is a form of life insurance which pays out a monthly
income (rather than a lump sum) should the worst happen.</p>
<p>Where traditional level of decreasing life insurance is often used to pay off an
outstanding mortgage in a single lump sum, a family income benefit policy is
designed primarily to provide an income to help maintain your dependant’s standard
of living until they reach an age at which they are likely to be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>If we assume a mortgage life insurance policy would have paid off the outstanding
mortgage on death, a family income benefit would continue to provide enough
income to meet the other essential outgoings such as food, utilities, school fees etc.
until your children reach an age where they have flown the nest.</p>
<p>It is common to set-up a family income benefit plan in addition to any life insurance
protecting the mortgage. The family income benefit would cover your essential
outgoings minus the mortgage and will often be aligned to run until your youngest
child is self-sufficient, at age 21 for example.</p><br/>
<p><strong>How would your dependants meet their essential outgoings if you were no
longer around?</strong></p>
<p>If you are unsure how these essential outgoings would be met or believe significant
hardship would be required to meet these bills it is sensible to look at ways you can
protect your dependant’s standard of living.</p>
<p>Family Income Benefit can ensure your loved ones are not met by these stresses
during difficult times by providing them with a monthly income to meet their essential
outgoings until they reach an age where they are able to meet these through their
own means.</p>
<p>Due to the way in which family income benefit policy is structured paying a monthly
income for the remainder of the policy term should a claim arise it is the most cost
effective form of life insurance.</p>
<p>As with any life insurance policy there are a few key factors which affect the
associated cost of the policy which include your age, smoker status and the level
and length of cover.</p>
<p>Most family income benefit plans do provide the option to include critical illness
cover, this means that the policy would not only pay out if you were to die but also if
you were to suffer one of a defined list of critical illnesses.</p>
<p>Including critical illness cover in your policy will increase your premiums because
there is a much greater risk of you suffering a serious illness than there of you dying.
The increase in premium will vary from insurer to insurer however given the
increased risk incurred by the insurer the price increase will be significant.
NB. It is important to bear in mind that a number of family protection plans will only
allow you to include critical illness cover if you opt for reviewable premiums.</p>
<p>If there is a real need for protection against ill-health we tend to recommend you
consider an alternative product called income protection as it can often be a more
cost-effective policy whilst providing a more comprehensive level of cover.
You can opt to take out family income benefit on a single or joint basis. If neither
yourself or your partner could survive without the others income to maintain the
standard of living for the family you should consider protecting both parties.</p>
