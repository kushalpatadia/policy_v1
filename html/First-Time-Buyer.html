          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
          		<p> Buying your first home as a contractor can be a daunting experience, so many lenders and
products, and not knowing what type of mortgage to select.</p>
<p> At Contractor Mortgages Direct, we will simplify the process for you, each and every one of our
consultants is fully versed on how to present your application to the lender.</p>
<p> There are many High Street lenders out there who we are fully experienced in working with to
have your application underwritten with the minimum of fuss.</p>
<p> We will need to talk to you in order to be certain that you will fit the lenders criteria and to ensure
that we get you the best deal on the high street, whatever type of mortgage will fit your profile
and whatever your needs are.</p>
<p> Every step of the home-buying process might be stressful, even for seasoned mortgagees. And
when it&#39;s your first home, we are aware that many of those steps will seem alien to you.</p>
<p> Our advice just does not stop at arranging the finance, we can recommend solicitors to ensure
that you are looked after during the conveyancing process that takes place after the finance has
been arranged which is when the lender will issue the formal mortgage offer. We believe that
each individual is a stakeholder to ensure that you reach your objective in the best manner
possible and make a stressful time less arduous.</p>
<h2>Specialist lending for first-time buyer contractors</h2>
<p>Contractor Mortgage Direct’ prime function is as an FCA-accredited specialist independent
mortgage broker. Our experience dealing with contractors from all walks has immeasurable
depth. We understand the different ways in which contractors operate:</p>
<p>Knowing how you work is key to us securing competitive first-time buyer contractor mortgages.
We’re so close to our underwriters, they often offer us exclusive terms, which we pass on to you. </p>
<p>Given this, we know we can secure you your first mortgage based on your true affordability. And
that’s important.</p>
<h2>Using your gross contract earnings to work what you can afford</h2>
<p>We can secure first time buyer contractor mortgages based on your gross contract earnings. This
is great news if you’ve just started contracting and/or have less than 3 years accounts. </p>
<p>From experience, we know that many first-time buyers fit into that bracket. When you realise your
greater disposable income, it conjures possibilities. </p>
<p>For many new to contracting, buying a home is their first milestone on the way to long-term
security. This is how we make it possible.</p>
<h2>Mortgages for contractors without accounts or payslips</h2>
<p>Contract based underwriting is the method we use and it doesn’t rely on accounts. This way, we
can incorporate your annualised day rate into the lender’s calculation. It’s also how we can
secure mortgages for contractors from their first contract. </p>
<p style="">Using this concept, we’ve agreed unique terms and rates with many mortgage lenders. Some of
those lenders you may have tried yourself already and failed.</p><p>But don’t worry. Their affordability calculation doesn’t factor in contract based underwriting. Ours
does and it means that contractors can get mortgages without accounts or payslips!</p>
<h2>First-time mortgages for Umbrella contractors</h2>
<p>It’s not only limited company contractors whom we can avail of contract-based underwriting. We
also help contractors operating through an umbrella payment structure. </p>
<p>And they do need help, even if they think they’ve got the best of both worlds with pay slips.
Those pay slips or tax returns differ from the permanent employees pay slip. </p>
<p>With most High Street advisers, prefer anything other than the norm, they fail at recognising the
alternative employment structures being adopted today, this is main problem umbrella workers
face. The net ‘take home’ figure on their pay slip won’t reflect the true value of their contract.</p>
<h2>Why choose Contractor Mortgages Direct to arrange your first mortgage?</h2>
<p>Contractor mortgages have been around for a decade, but adoption on the High Street has been
slow, with the branch advisers being slow to recognise the many different employment types,
contractor based underwriting is a niche and you really do need someone who will be able to do</p>
<p>We have masses of experience when it comes to assessing contractor application prior to
submission to ensure that it fits that particular lender, we will source you the best deal, bringing a
transparent process to you, to ensure that you understand what we are doing and how we are
presenting your application,</p>
<p>We can’t emphasise enough the importance of a specialist broker handling your mortgage
application. It’s even more important when you’re a first-time buyer. You need to begin your
quest for homeownership on a solid, but affordable, platform to ensure that you have the right
advice by a regulated mortgage broker.</p>
