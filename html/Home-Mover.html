          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
          		<p>As a contractor, you need a mortgage broker who understands your income structure to ensure that
you have the best mortgage deal and lender for your particular situation.</p>
<p>You may have previously got a mortgage via a broker or your local branch when lending policies were more relaxed, and now your income has changed structure, we are best placed to fully asess your income, 
before we place it to a lender, and it is not a one size fits all process, there are nearly 100 lenders out there who all have differing 
polices to each other, and there is always a lender there who is willing to consider your application, the High Street branch you have been banking with
may not be the best option for you, or if you have been refused by one lender, this does not mean that you should give up.</p>
<p>Talk to us and we will ensure that we explore all options with you and in many cases we can help, we have read the forums where ther are armchair
 advisers out their who tell you to go to a certain bank becasue that particular lender lent them the money they needed to buy their castle, this may not be
the best route for you though, you need advice and navigation to the best lender, we will handle your application and do all the legwork for you.
We have many satified clients who we have helped secure a mortgage for</p>
<p>Self cert mortgages no longer exist, maybe your bank is asking for your books or accounts, we will
not ask you for these and we can get your application underwritten based upon your gross contract
value, this is like the full turnover of your annual contract.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible to port your existing mortgage to a new property, even if your existing lender
says no. We have years of experience and have handled many applications, and have the best teams to talk to within the lenders to ensure that your
 application moves at a swift pace.</p>
<p>At Contractor Mortgages Direct we are experts and specialize in contractor mortgages and mortgages for self employed individuals, lets not forget to 
mention credit impaired persons, niche incomes is what we love dealing with and are recogised in the industry for.</p>
