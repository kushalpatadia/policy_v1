          <h2 class="custom-title"><span>Income Protection Insurance</span></h2>
          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
          		<p>Formerly known as permanent health insurance, income protection insurance is
designed to protect up to 70% of your gross income in both the short and long term
should you be unable to work due to accident or sickness. In the case of short term
protection, unemployment cover can be included to insure yourself against the risk of
forced redundancy.</p>
<p>We all insure our cars and homes however we often forget to protect what pays for it
all, our earnings.</p>
<p>Given the level of government support available and with fewer employers offering
long term sick pay above and beyond Statutory Sick Pay*, a personal income
protection policy is more important than ever.</p><br/>
<p>Income Protection is usually relevant to anyone who relies on their earnings to
survive and doesn’t receive Group Income Protection as an employee benefit from
their employer.</p><br/>
<p><strong>Being employed…</strong></p>
<p>If you’re employed you may be lucky enough to receive full sick pay from your
employer. That’s great, but from our 2015 Protection Survey we found that over half
of workers receive 3 months or less in full sick pay yet 1 in 5 had needed to take
over 3 months off work due to ill health.</p>
<p><strong>Income protection for the self-employed…</strong></p>
<p>If you’re self-employed you would need to make your own sick pay provisions as
naturally you don’t have an employer to cover your income when you’re ill and you
wouldn’t be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from the State.
Government Support</p>
<p>According to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) there were over 370,000
people claiming Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for incapacity in August
2009.</p>
<p>With ESA standing at only £73.10 per week maximum, permanent health insurance
allows many individuals to maintain their standard of living should they lose their
income due to sickness or injury. Since 2005, DWP figures also show that the
average claim for incapacity benefit stands at nearly 3 years.</p>
<p>There are certain lifestyle events where we tend to take on more responsibility and
realise just how important it is to protect our income should we suffer an illness or
injury which renders us unable to earn a wage.</p><br/>
 
<p><strong>Buying a home</strong></p>

<p>Our home is often our most valuable asset and many of us end up tied in to repaying
the mortgage for the majority of our working life.
When signing up to a 30-year mortgage and realising the monthly repayments will
need to be met in health or sickness we tend to take stock and realise without a
good income protection policy it is likely we would not be able to keep up those
repayments for too long without a regular income.</p><br/>
 
<p><strong>Changing jobs</strong></p>

<p>Moving to a new job or getting a promotion is when we tend to review the employee
benefits we receive.</p>
<p>Unless you are lucky enough to work at a company with a good group income
protection scheme you quickly become very aware of the limited full sick pay your
employer will provide before you are reliant on Statutory Sick Pay at £89.35 per
week. Making your own arrangements with a personal income protection plan
ensures you are suitably protected.</p><br/>
 

<p><strong>Becoming self employed</strong></p>

<p>With self-employment comes many freedoms but it also requires you to look after
yourself financially should you become too ill or injured to work.
Whether you are a tradesman or an IT contractor it is sensible to consider protecting
yourself financially with comprehensive sickness insurance so you do not need to
worry where your next salary payment is coming from if you are ill to provide your
service.</p><br/>

 
<p><strong>Birth of a child</strong></p>

<p>Having a child is one of life’s many miracles and provides you with a bundle of joy
you want nothing more than to protect. If you are the main breadwinner having an
extra dependant who will rely on your salary is another reason to make sure your
income is adequately protected.
This is also a good time to consider family income benefit which provides your child
with financial support via an annual income should you pass away.</p><br/>

 

<p>When might income protection not be necessary?</p>

<p>Although Income Protection is considered the one protection policy every working
adult should have there are certain circumstances where it may not be required.</p>
<ul>
<li> You are a member of your company’s group income protection scheme which would protect your income until
you retire should you be unable to work due to illness or injury.</li>
<li> You could rely on Statutory Sick Pay alone at £89.35 per week should you fall ill.</li>
<li> You have a partner who is the main breadwinner and would be able to support you until you recovered and were
able to return to work.</li>
<li> You have substantial savings which you could live off if you were unable to work, just bear in mind the average
length of a claim for LV and Aviva are 7 and 9 years respectively.</li>
</ul><br/>
<p><strong>Getting own occupation income insurance is very important</strong></p>
<p>The first point to make is that if your policy covers you in your own occupation then
the policy would cover you for any medical condition that prevents you from
undertaking the main duties of your normal occupation, meaning that the plan even
covers conditions like back pain and depression in addition to accidents, cancers
and so on.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when I need to claim?</strong></p>
<p>If you suffer an illness or injury that prevents you from working then you make a
claim with the insurer* and your protection policy will start to pay a monthly benefit
after the end of your deferred period (see ‘your policy options’ below for more
information).</p>
<p>Once claiming the policy will continue to pay you each month either until you are well
enough to return to work, you reach the end of the policy life (which is often set at
your expected retirement age) or if you have a short-term policy you have been
claiming for 12 or 24 months, depending on which option you have selected (long-
term plans don’t have this last restriction and can therefore pay out for many years).</p>
<p>Listed below are the main policy options you have when taking out cover:</p>
<p><strong>Monthly benefit amount</strong></p>
<p>This is the amount you would like the policy to pay you each month. Depending on
the insurer it is possible to cover between 50-70% of your gross salary. The amount
paid to you would be free from income tax. It makes sense to work out how much
your essential outgoings are each month and ensure at least that much is covered.</p>
<p><strong>Deferred period</strong></p>
<p>This is the length of time you need to be off work before your policy kicks in and
starts to pay out. Deferred periods range from as short as 1 day right up to 12
months. The most common deferred periods are 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 13 weeks.
When setting the deferred period consider how long your employer would provide
you with full sick pay or how long you could live off savings. The longer the deferred
period the cheaper the policy.</p>
<p><strong>Policy cease age/</strong></p>

<p>This is the term of the policy (i.e. the age you would like the policy to run until) and is
often set at the age you expect to retire but it is sometimes set at the age you expect
your mortgage to be repaid, so you at least have that covered.</p>
<p>Maximum pay out period</p>
<p>This is the maximum length of time that you can make a continuous claim. With short
term income protection, it is usually only possible to claim for up to 1 or 2 years, but
some plans can only pay out for as little as 6 months. With long-term income
protection there isn’t this restriction so the policy would pay out either until you are
well enough to return to work or you reach the policy cease age.</p>
<p>Guaranteed, age banded or reviewable premiums</p>
<p>Some policies come with age banded premiums that rise each year as you get older,
others with reviewable premiums where the insurer has the right to increase them
periodically over time and other plans have guaranteed premiums where the amount
you pay is fixed for the entire term of the policy. Guaranteed premiums are often
higher at the start but can work out considerably cheaper over the life of the policy.</p>
<p>Indexation</p>
<p>You also have the option to index your monthly benefit so that it increases each year
in line with inflation. A pint of milk cost a lot less 20 years ago than it does now so
having your cover indexed for inflation enables you to maintain the purchasing power
of your monthly benefit over time.</p>

<p><strong>Specialist income protection for company directors</strong></p><br/>

<p>With more and more people in the UK starting their own businesses and/or turning to
contract work where there is no employer sick pay or SSP the need for income
protection is even more acute. With company directors often paying themselves a
small salary and the rest of their income being made up of dividends there is an
opportunity for the business to own and pay for the plan on behalf of the director, this
is called Executive Income Protection and is an alternative to taking out cover
personally.</p>
<p>The premium charged by the insurer for this type of cover will depend on a number
of factors, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> The monthly benefit – Naturally the more you want to insure per month the higher the monthly premium will be.</li>
<li> The deferred period – The longer you have to be off work ill or injured before the policy kicks in and starts
paying out the lower the premium.</li>
<li> The policy cease age – The longer the policy runs the more chance there is that you will need to claim and
therefore the higher the premium charged.</li>
<li> Your age – The older you are when you take out the policy the higher the chance that you’ll need to make a
claim and therefore the premium is higher.</li>
<li> Your smoker status – The risk of serious illness increases significantly if you smoke and the premium charged
by the insurer follows suit to reflect this.</li>
</ul><br/>

<p><strong>Increasing premiums due to medical history</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the above, if you have suffered from an illness or injury in the past the
insurer may place an exclusion on the policy or decide to offer cover for that same
ailment but increase the premium charged due to the increased chance of a claim
being made for that condition. If you think this may apply to you then get in touch and
one of our advisers will be able to find you the best terms across all leading insurers.
When you take out income protection what you hope is that if you suffer an illness or
injury and can’t do your job your policy will pay-out. This is what we hope too but
that’s not always the case. The reason for this is because not all policies include the
‘own occupation’ definition of incapacity.</p>
<p>With own occupation income protection cover the policy will pay-out for any
medical reason that prevents you from undertaking the main duties of your normal
occupation. This is how it should be but a lot of plans have much less
comprehensive incapacity definitions.</p><br/>
 

<p><strong>Avoiding suited occupation income cover</strong></p>

<p><h4>Be careful because a lot of policies use the suited occupation
incapacity definition rather than the own occupation definition.</h4></p><br/>
<p>Although you may not be able to work in your normal occupation, with the suited
definition the insurer would also assess whether you are able to undertake another
job to which you may be suited given your skills, experience or education.
This can make a massive difference when it comes to making a claim.
Why avoid suited occupation cover…</p>
<p>Supposing you’re a painter and decorator but can no longer climb a ladder due to
injury, the insurer could decline your claim stating that you are still well enough to
work in a DIY store advising people on what paint to buy, even if you’d get paid a lot
less doing so.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you’re a pilot and you lose sight in one of your eyes meaning you’re
not legally allowed to fly anymore, the insurer could decline your claim stating that
you could teach navigation instead.</p>
<p>If you thought that definition of incapacity was bad, it’s not the worst! There is also a
‘work tasks’ or ‘activities of daily living’ definition where you would have to fail a
certain number of physical tasks, like dressing yourself or walking upstairs, to be
able to make a claim.</p>
<p>The vast majority of policies do not have any standard exclusions, meaning that
the policy could pay-out for any medical condition that prevented you from working in
your normal job (provided you have Own Occupation cover). The plans that do have
standard exclusions usually restrict these to drug abuse, self-harm or war and civil
commotion.</p><br/>
<p><strong>Medical History and Hazardous Activities</strong></p>
<p>Although most plans do not have any standard exclusions, when applying for the
policy you often need to declare any medical conditions you may have suffered or
whether you partake in hazardous hobbies (such as motor racing) and the insurer
may apply a specific exclusion in these circumstances.</p>
<p>If you have suffered a medical condition or partake in a hazardous hobby please get
in touch and one of our advisers can take down the details, call the underwriting
departments at each insurer and let you know which insurer is likely to offer you the
best terms. It is very common for one insurer to apply an exclusion where another
insurer is willing to take the risk.</p>
<p>With income insurance there are generally two types of plans – long-term and short-
term.</p>
<p><strong>Short Term Protection</strong></p>
<p>Short-term plans can usually only pay-out for 6 months to 2 years. That may sound
like a long time but according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) the average
claim length on an income protection policy is around 4 years.</p>
<p><strong>Long Term Protection</strong></p>
<p>It is true that you would likely be able to get back to work within 6 months if you
broke your leg, but what about if you got cancer or were paralysed in a road traffic
accident, you may never be able to go back to work. This is where long-term income
protection can be worth its weight in gold as the policy would continue to pay-out
until you are well enough to return to work, whether that is in a year or 10 years.
Also, be careful of policies that specifically call themselves ‘short-term income
protection’ as many of these plans use the suited occupation definition of incapacity
and often have the same restrictive terms and conditions as a payment protection
insurance policy.</p>
<p>Stories about insurers not paying claims are often in the press. The reason for this is
because it makes a good story for the newspaper. Unfortunately, this creates a
hugely exaggerated view that ‘insurers don’t pay-out’. This couldn’t be further from
the truth.</p>
<p>The Association of British Insurers (ABI) collect aggregate claims data across
insurers and in 2016 of all protection insurance claims made 97.3% were paid,
amounting to a total pay-out of £4.7 billion. That’s an impressive figure by anyone’s
standards. It will never be 100% as there are always going to be situations were a
speculative or fraudulent claim is made.</p>
