          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
          		<p><strong>Life insurance</strong> is a simple protection product which is designed to pay out a lump
sum should you die during the life of your plan. The benefit payment is paid to your
loved ones to help them cope financially during such difficult times.</p>
<p>When set-up correctly the benefit payment is paid out tax-free to your beneficiaries
to use however they see fit, it could be used to pay off a mortgage, any outstanding
loans or just to help with everyday financial commitments whilst they get back on to
their feet.</p>
<p>There are different types of life insurance to consider depending on your
circumstances so it is best to do your research. The three most common are level life
insurance, decreasing life insurance and whole of life insurance.</p>
<p>Most people consider life insurance at certain key points during their life such as
getting married, buying a home or having a child. When considering whether you
need this form of protection you need to ask yourself how your loved ones would
cope should the worst happen to you? From a financial standpoint would they be
able to continue life as normal?</p>
<p>Common sense prevailing most individuals see life insurance as a very important
form of protection should they have a family and/or have any significant outstanding
debts such as a mortgage.</p>
<p>Although it is not nice to think about if something was to happen you, we believe
most people would like to remove any financial pressure from their loved ones so
they can focus on dealing with their loss and getting back up on their feet.</p>
<p>The simplest way to remove these pressures is with a simple life insurance product.
Decreasing life insurance is most commonly used to protect a repayment mortgage.
The policy will be taken out for the length of the mortgage and the level of cover will
decline over time in line with you repaying your mortgage and reducing this debt to
zero.</p>
<p>Decreasing term insurance is the most cost-effective form of life insurance for
repayment mortgages as the risk to insurer declines over time as the level of cover
falls, as a result the monthly premiums are a lot lower than a traditional level life
insurance policy.</p>
<p><strong>Level life insurance</strong> is the simplest of all the life products, you choose a level of
cover (£500,000) and a length of cover (30 years) and should you pass away at any
point during those 30 years the policy would pay out £500,000 to your loved ones.
Level term life cover is most commonly used to protect an interest only mortgage or
provide a level of family protection. Where you are not repaying the capital on an
interest only mortgage the outstanding debt remains the same over the life of the
mortgage, and therefore so should the amount of life cover.</p>

<p>Other uses include providing a level of family protection, setting up a policy with a
level of cover which would help your loved ones through the difficult times to ensure
any financial pressures are removed.</p>
<p>Most life insurance plans have the option of including critical illness cover. Where life
insurance only pays out on death, a critical illness plan pays out the sum assured
should you be diagnosed with any one of the 35-50 serious illnesses as defined by
the insurers terms, these conditions include the likes of cancer, heart attack and
stroke.</p>
<p>Given the risk of suffering a serious illness is a lot higher than that of dying, the
monthly premium will increase significantly to include critical illness cover in your
policy. Should you suffer a serious illness there are often lifestyle changes whether
that be reducing working hours, stopping work completely or modifications to your
home which can all have a considerably impact on your finances.</p>
<p>Many individuals opt for critical illness cover for the peace of mind it offers should
something serious happen, when deciding whether or not to include critical illness
cover it is important not only to consider your current health and lifestyle risks but
also to plan ahead for the future.</p>
<p>Whether you look to take the policy out to retirement or to the end of your mortgage
it is likely to be a significant length of time. It is important to bear in mind with any
form of protection you are able to lock in the cost of your monthly premium
(guaranteed premiums) when you sign up to a plan, thus the earlier you take out the
policy the more competitive your premiums will be.</p>

<p>Writing a life insurance policy into a trust means at claims stage the benefit is paid
from the life insurer directly into the trust to then be distributed to the nominated
beneficiaries. Writing a policy into trust is the best way to ensure the insurer pays out
quickly and the lump sum benefit gets paid to the correct beneficiary’s tax free.
Our experts are on hand to help with this however the general rule of thumb is that a
policy taken out as a single individual should be placed into trust whereas a joint
policy would not necessarily need to be placed into trust as the benefit is paid
directly to the surviving policyholder. </p>
