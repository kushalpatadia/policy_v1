          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
          		<p>There are many types of mortgages around for contractors. So many in fact that the choice can
be overwhelming and you probably don&#39;t know where to start. You know you&#39;ll want to pick the
best lender with the best interest rate that you can have. </p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot to take into account before deciding which mortgage you want. </p>
<p>You&#39;ll find it helps if you have a broad understanding of how mortgages work and the various
different kinds of mortgage available. </p>
<h2>How do contractor mortgages work?</h2>
<p>All contractor mortgages work in the same way: you borrow money to buy a property, pay
interest on the mortgage and eventually pay it back at some point. </p>
<p>But then if it is so easy why do you need a specialist mortgage broker, the reason is because it is
very complicated, so many lenders, so many products and that is before all the different lender
criteria qualification</p>
<ul>
<li> different interest rates</li>
<li> different ways to repay</li>
<li> borrowing for different periods of time</li>
<li> particular mortgages for special situations</li>
<li> various charges to pay</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the different types of mortgage?</h2>
<p>There&#39;s a long list:</p>
<ul>
<li> repayment mortgages</li>
<li> interest-only mortgages</li>
<li> fixed rate mortgages</li>
<li> variable rate mortgages</li>
<li> tracker mortgages</li>
<li> discounted rate mortgages</li>
<li> capped rate mortgages</li>
<li> cashback mortgages</li>
<li> offset mortgages</li>
<li> 95% mortgages</li>
<li> flexible mortgages</li>
<li> first time buyer mortgages</li>
<li> buy to let mortgages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contractor Repayment mortgages</h3>
<p>This is the basic way of repaying all mortgages, however specialised they are, apart from interest
only loans which are different.</p>
<p>With repayment mortgages, each month you repay some of the interest you owe plus some of
the capital you&#39;ve borrowed. At the end of the period, often 20-30 years, you&#39;ll have paid back
everything you owe and you&#39;ll own your home outright.</p>
<p>But more than likely you will move within the 30 years. In this case, you might be able to take the
mortgage with you (called &#39;porting&#39; your mortgage) or you can repay the original loan and take
out a new one, this will all depend on the early repayment charge.</p>
<p>It could be that, by the time you move, your house has gone up in value and anyway you will
have repaid some of the capital. So next time you can put down a bigger deposit and possibly
find a new mortgage at a better rate of interest.</p>
<h3>Contractor Interest only mortgages</h3>
<p>With interest-only loans, you pay just the interest month by month and repay the capital at the
end of the period with money you&#39;ve saved elsewhere. This is quite different from a repayment
mortgage because at the end of the loan you&#39;ll have to find enough money to repay the whole
debt. You can save up any way you want or use money from an inheritance but you must be
confident of having the money to hand when the time comes to repay. If you don&#39;t, you might
have to sell the house to pay off the mortgage. You could be lucky and find that your home has
increased so much in price that the extra value is enough to re-mortgage and pay off the debt.
There&#39;s still a risk that won&#39;t be able to repay the mortgage on time so, before granting an
interest-only mortgage, lenders can insist you show them how you intend repaying the loan at the
end. The big advantage of interest only mortgages is that your monthly repayments are lower
than with any other mortgage because you are paying only the interest due. If you find you&#39;re
getting nervous about being able to repay the loan on an interest only basis, you may be able to
switch to a repayment loan at a later date.</p>
<h3>Fixed rate mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>Fixed rate mortgages are popular, particularly with first time buyers, because your mortgage rate
is fixed for a set number of years - usually 2, 3 or 5 years but sometimes 10 years. You know
exactly how much you&#39;ll be paying each month for that length of time, regardless of what
happens to interest rates on other mortgages. The downside is that you&#39;ll be stuck on a higher
rate if other mortgage rates go down. You can get out of a fixed rate mortgage but there&#39;ll be an
early repayment charge to pay for switching before the end of the period. When the mortgage
comes to an end, you&#39;ll be put on the lender&#39;s standard variable rate (SVR) which will probably
have a higher interest rate than you&#39;ve been paying. In that case you can apply for another fixed
rate deal.</p>
<h3>Variable rate mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>Every lender has a standard variable rate (SVR) mortgage. This is their basic mortgage. The
interest rate goes up and down as mortgage rates generally change. They are partly influenced
by the Bank of England base rate but other factors come into play as well. The interest rate you
pay on an SVR mortgage can change even without base rate moving and similarly base rate
might come down but your mortgage rate stays the same. We would strongly recommend that if
you are on the SVR with a lender to speak to us and we will find you an alternative.</p>
<h3>Tracker mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>Tracker mortgages move in line with (i.e. they track) a nominated interest rate which is usually
the Bank of England base rate. The actual mortgage rate you pay will be a set interest rate
above or below the base rate. When base rate goes up, your mortgage rate will go up by the
same amount. And it&#39;ll come down when base rate comes down.</p>
<p>Some lenders set a minimum rate below which your interest rate will never drop but there&#39;s no
limit to how high it can go.</p>
<h3>Discount rate mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>The discount is a reduction on the lender&#39;s standard variable rate (SVR). Mortgages with
discounted rates are some of the cheapest around but, as they are linked to the SVR, the rate
will go up and down when the SVR changes.</p>
<h3>Capped rate mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>This is a variable rate mortgage but one with a ceiling (a cap) on how high your interest rate can
rise. You have the comfort of knowing that your repayments will never exceed a certain level
while you can still benefit when rates go down. As mortgage rates generally have been low in
recent years and there are better deals around, lenders don&#39;t often offer capped rate mortgages
at the moment.</p>
<h3>Cashback mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>This is a marketing incentive sometimes offered by lenders. When you take out their mortgage,
they give you money back, typically a percentage of the loan. This isn&#39;t necessarily as attractive
as it first sounds. You should look carefully at the interest rate being charged and any additional
fees as you&#39;ll likely find cheaper mortgages without cashback.</p>
<h3>Offset mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>Offset mortgages are linked to a savings account and combine savings and mortgage together. 
Each month, the lender looks at how much you owe on the mortgage and then deducts the
amount you have in savings. You pay mortgage interest just on the difference between the two.
For example, if you have a mortgage of £100,000 and savings of £20,000, your mortgage
interest is calculated on £80,000 for that month. This cuts the amount of interest you pay. You
can still access your savings if you need to but the more you offset, the quicker you&#39;ll repay your
mortgage. When you use your savings to reduce your mortgage interest, you won&#39;t earn any
interest on them but you won&#39;t pay tax either which is particularly helpful for higher rate
taxpayers.</p>
<h3>95% mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>These are for people who can afford only a 5% deposit. With such a small deposit you are at risk
of falling into negative equity if house prices go down - they need fall only 6% and suddenly your
house is worth less than your mortgage. Because of the risk, lenders will charge a comparatively
high mortgage rate, this alone may put you off getting the 95%, but please do speak to us, it is
free to have a quick short conversation.</p>
<h3>Flexible mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>Flexible mortgages give you more leeway with making repayments. You can choose to pay in
more than your regular amount when you can afford it (this option is also available on many other
types of mortgage). And, unlike other mortgages, if you have already overpaid you can pay less if
you hit a difficult patch or even take a payment holiday and miss a few payments altogether.</p>
<h3>First time buyer contractor mortgages</h3>
<p>First time buyers can apply for any of the types of mortgages listed above. The government also
has a help to buy scheme to help get people on to the property ladder.</p>
<h3>Help to buy contractor mortgages</h3>
<p>We can help you get a contractor mortgage on the government equity help to buy scheme, we
will get you assessed under the contractor underwriting process as opposed to the general self-
employed route, this will be much more favourable to you</p>
<h3>Buy to let mortgages for contractors</h3>
<p>Buy to let mortgages are for people who want to buy a property and rent it out rather than live in
it themselves. The amount you can borrow is at least partly based on the amount of rent you
expect to receive. First time buyers are unlikely to be allowed a buy to let mortgage.</p>
<p>Before you decide which mortgage is right for you, there are more decisions you need to take.
How long should you fix your mortgage for? Should you choose a fixed or variable rate
mortgage? The rental income required, because BTL mortgages are assessed upon them being
self-sufficient on the rental income rather than your personal income, so in short, the rent plays a
big part in how much you can borrow.</p>
