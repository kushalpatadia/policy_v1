          		<p>Re-mortgaging as a contractor, is basically refinancing your current mortgage to another lender
or the same lender. You may be wanting to borrow more for that extension, or a buy to let
investment.</p>
<p>If your current fixed deal is coming to the end of its initial period then now is the time to talk to us
and see what we can offer you</p>
<p>With over 15,000 mortgage products to select from, we are certain that you will not be
disappointed, if your current term interest rate is due to end or you are paying your lender’s
standard variable rate (SVR), there is a strong chance that you can save money by re-
mortgaging.</p>
<p>It is easy to think that re-mortgaging is a lengthy and confusing task, but that couldn’t be farther
from the truth.</p>
<p>We have helped thousands of people re-mortgage and save money, do not just go straight to
your bank and ask them for the best deal, the bank you are with will only offer you deals from
their range, it is wise to get an independent broker like us to scour the market for you and find
you the best deal, going to a comparison website looking for a deal is definitely another non-
starter, as you cannot find best products from these websites.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that you were employed when you last took out your mortgage or your
circumstances have changed since that time, it is very important that you seek advice from one
of the consultants at contractor mortgages Direct and it even more important that you do not just
stick with your existing lender just for sake of ease, get professional advice from one of our
experienced brokers before making a decision.</p>
<p>Give us 15 minutes of your time and we promise that we will find you the best deal, with many
years of experience behind us, we are confident that you will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>What have you got to lose, apart from 15 minutes?</p>
