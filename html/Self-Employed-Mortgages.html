          <div style="margin-top:20px; text-align:left;">
          		<p>It’s important to remember that every lender is different. They all have a varied opinion on a
massive range of criteria, which can make finding the right mortgage very complex. When it comes
to self-employed applicants, certain lenders request 2 or more full years of accounts to prove
income, where some lenders are able to offer a mortgage with just one year’s set of accounts.</p>
<p>Some lenders consider businesses that have had a decline in profits in recent years, some decline
even for smallest decline in profit. The lenders change criteria all the time, as every lender alters
their stance on what is and is not acceptable – for this reason it would be inappropriate to list
lenders as it could very soon be outdated. So, if you’re self-employed and looking to get a mortgage,
the best advice would be to find a specialist broker that knows when and where the best deals are to
be had, and which lenders would consider an application before you even start.</p>
<p>On mortgages for self-employed applicants it’s important to remember that every lender does things
differently, and each occupies a different space in the market, so it’s important not to give up if
you’ve been declined with one lender. Within each sector, different lenders still have differing
criteria, some will lend on concrete properties, and some won’t. Some will let you get a buy to let
mortgage as a first-time buyer, some wont. Similarly, some will lend to the self-employed, some
won’t.</p>
<p>The truth is, getting a mortgage is much harder than it used to be across the board, not just for self-
employed applicants. Financial Conduct Authority regulation has come in, and because of the lack of
money available following the ‘credit crunch’, things have really tightened up, so lenders have to
pick and choose who they give their money to.</p>
<p>As a result, self-certified mortgages have been removed from the market (although it is still possible
to get a self-cert secured loan if you are looking for additional borrowing). This means the self-
employed builder or taxi driver, writing off profit as expenses and declaring less income, will find it
much harder to borrow to the same levels, if at all. This has created difficulties in buying and moving,
and in some cases created mortgage ‘traps’ where customers have been lent money pre-regulation,
and are now unable to find any other lender to take their mortgage on in the same terms.</p>
<p>Keep the faith though – just because you have been turned down by your own bank, doesn’t
necessarily mean you can’t qualify for a mortgage anywhere. Contractor Mortgages Direct have
whole of market access and will be able to put you in front of lenders with a more flexible attitude –
and there are a few reputable organisations out there that you won’t see on the high street (and
probably won’t have ever heard of!) that you can only access through us here.</p>
<p>We have unique experience in which to get Company Directors assessed, to unlock the full potential
of borrowing for them, we also have unique relationships which enable us to present your case to
the decision makers at the lenders to ensure that your application succeeds.</p>
<p>Why not get in touch, we can get you a mortgage with as little as 1 year’s books.</p>
