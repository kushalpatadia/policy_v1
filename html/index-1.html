We spoke in detail to the lender, and explained the situation, within a few days this was agreed and this then resulted in Stephanie receiving the 
mortgage offer in 6 working days from the initial conversation, to say Stephanie was impressed, is an understatement.</p><br/>

                  <p class="text-gray-600">The simple answer is No, you dоn’t. At Contractor Mortgages Direct, lenders have agreed to 
work with us to assess you based рurеlу on your daily соntrасt rate. Whісh mеаnѕ thаt уоu do not have tо рrоvе уоu hаvе
bееn wоrkіng as a соntrасtоr fоr уеаrѕ, the lender definitely does not want to see your

                  <p class="text-gray-600">The lender will typically like to see 4 weeks remaining on your contract, if shorter than
this they would like to know if you have an extension or another contract to move onto, they
will require evidence of this.</p>

contractor with you, then we will make a recommendation, With 95% of our customers
we are able to place on the high street, with a fantastic interest rate, the remaining 5%
due to adverse credit in most cases we are unable to place on the High Street, and have to
look at a niche lender who caters for this type of client.</p>

                  <p class="text-gray-600">We will not carry out a credit search on you, the lender will do this when we request a 
Decision In Principle also known as a Mortgage In Principle or Agreement In Principle, most lenders now only perform what is known as a soft search,
you can see this on your credit file but outside organisations do not, Lenders tend to carry out a full search also known as a hard footprint at the
point of a full application, if you have concerns regarding this, please talk to us and we will explain in more detail to you, at no point will we 
carry out a search without your express consent. Credit Bureau Data is obtained by the lender, and each lender differs who they obtain it from, 
either Call Credit, Equifax or Experian, these are the three main Credit Bureau's that hold your financial information, it is always worth obtaining a 
credit report prior to submitting an application to ensure you are are in a position to correctly let us know about outstanding credit and any other 
relevant information. We can steer you in the right direction to get the report should you need it.</p>
